Code Overview
=============

The provided Python script is composed of three main classes, each serving a distinct purpose:

JiraData Class:
---------------
The `JiraData` class is responsible for retrieving data from JIRA. It facilitates data collection, filtering,
and transformation, making it the foundation for subsequent analysis.

ExcelExporter Class:
--------------------
The `ExcelExporter` class takes the processed data from the `JiraData` class and creates an Excel file with
the relevant information. This class enhances data usability by allowing users to conveniently export
and share the analyzed data.

StreamlitApp Class:
-------------------
The `StreamlitApp` class integrates the processed data with a user-friendly Streamlit interface. It provides
the user with an interactive environment to input parameters, trigger data analysis, and view results.
This class bridges the gap between data processing and user interaction.

Main Function:
--------------
The script includes a main function that orchestrates the interaction of the three main classes. It initializes
and coordinates the workflow, ensuring that data retrieval, processing, and user interaction are seamlessly
integrated.

By leveraging these classes and their interactions, the script offers a solution for retrieving,
analyzing, and presenting JIRA data.
